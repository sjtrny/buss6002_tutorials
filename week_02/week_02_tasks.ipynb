    "## Task 1 - Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The sales team wants to know if there is evidence of a relationship between the amount of catalogs sent to customers and the amount that they spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ``DirectMarketing.csv`` dataset:\n",
    "1. Create a scatter plot to visualise the relationship (x-axis is number of catalogs)\n",
    "2. Describe the relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting with Clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to accurately label all axes and title with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x-axis label: \"Number of Catalogs\"\n",
    "- y-axis label: \"Amount Spent\"\n",
    "- title: \"Amount Spent vs Number of Catalogs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the ``alpha`` parameter of the ``scatter`` function to control the transparency of the points to better understand the density.\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.scatter(... , ... , alpha = 0.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2 - Historical Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The sales team wants to know what the trend of average customer spending is over the past 5 years. Each year the company randomly samples 1000 customers. You have already been given one year in the ``DirectMarketing.csv`` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpfully the sales team has given you a new file called ``AmountSpent_13to17.csv``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this file to calculate the average (mean) customer spend per year. Present your results as a line plot. Don't forget to label all axes, title etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your goal\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/historical.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following code to label your x axis ticks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.xticks( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ['2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017'] )\n",
