    "4. **Optional Extension**: Can you think of a statistical test that can be used to determine if there is a difference in the amount spent between the different catalog groups? Try to implement this. Common tests can be found in the scipy package https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html\n",
